/**
 * Use this to add, alter, or delete the simple built-in route rules.
 * The route rules are used by Jaxer to determine from the URL of a request
 * what application and page is being requested, which are in turn used to
 * load the appropriate application- and page-level containers (session-type stores).
 * 
 * Each of the functions in the configRoutes array will be called in turn, 
 * with the single argument being the page's url object as returned by Util.parseUrl().
 * They need to return either null, to indicate they don't match,
 * or an an array of the string that identifies the app and the string that identifies the page.
 * 
 * The following example adds the following rules:
 * 1) demos.aptana.com/XXX/YYY...	-> is the "XXX" app in Aptana demos, and YYY... identifies the page
 * 2) XXX.aptana.com/YYY...			-> is the "XXX" app in Aptana, and YYY... identifies the page
 * Note that, in this case, rule 1 isn't needed because it's covered by the (default) rule 2
